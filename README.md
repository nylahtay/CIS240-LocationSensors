## Project Setup
You will want to follow the step to get this setup.

Create an empty folder inside your AndroidStudioProjects and name it anything you would like. (I named my folder LocationSensorsGroupProject)
Navigate to it inside your Command Prompt (it's usually inside C:\Users\USERNAME\AndroidStudioProjects\)

Run the following replacing USERNAME and FOLDERNAME

```
cd \Users\USERNAME\AndroidStudioProjects\FOLDERNAME
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/nylahtay/CIS240-LocationSensors.git
git fetch
git checkout main
